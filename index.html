      <p>My name is Johnson. I hold first degree in accounting and finance and I have two years working experience in that field. Feeling somehow uncomfortable in that field, I started researching about various professions and I found out software development is the way to go where one thing could be done in more that hundred ways and the challenges are so enormous. I am currently attending Case Western Reserve University Coding BootCamp and I am proud to see myself getting some tiny codes to run on the browser which I called the virtual magic. 
        </p>

      <p>I have a passion to create top notch technologies to solve business problems of which I have an edge with my background and I am eager about approaching software development challenges with full enthusiasm in order to collaborate and build a meaningful web applications. Moreover, I crave to collaborate with other developers so that I can learn and share. I have seen myself working under little supervision and beating the deadline in some circumstances. I see communication in a concise and clear manner as a way to endear myself and collaborate effectively with colleagues both seniors and at the same level and I have inculcated this into my lifestyle. </p>
