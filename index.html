    <p>I enjoy the creativity and challenges that coding entails. My education and exprience in finance has really helped me to bring creativity and differnt perspective to solve sofware development problems. </p>


      <p>I hold a degree in Accounting and recently graduated from Case Western Reserve University Coding BootCamp. I possessed an unwavering love for tech and I love the challenges it involves. I am exprienced working with html, css and javascript. I have laid my hands on so many other javascript libraries like jQuery, react for front-end and Node.js, Expressjs for back-end. I have used many of these technologies to build projects, some of them are showcase in my portfolio page. I am open to learn new technologies as I progress in the profession.
